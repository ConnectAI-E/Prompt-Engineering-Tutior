00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,840
Congratulations on making it to the end of this short course

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,280
In summary, in this short course

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,380
you've learned about two key principles for prompting

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,480
right clearance for specific instructions and when it's appropriate

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,160
give the model time to think

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,080
You also learned about iterative prompt development and how

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,200
having a process to get to the prompt is right for your application is key

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,800
And we went through a few capabilities of

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,640
large language models that are useful for many applications

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,320
specifically summarizing, inferring, transforming, and expanding

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,880
And you also saw how to build a custom chatbot

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,320
That was a lot that you learned in just one short course

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,240
and I hope you enjoyed going through these materials

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,920
We hope you'll come up with some ideas for

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,120
applications that you can build yourself now

16
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,120
And please go try this out and let us know what you come up with

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,720
No application is too small

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,000
It's fine to start with something that's kind of

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,800
a very small project with maybe a little bit of utility

20
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,800
or maybe it's not even useful at all

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,320
It's just something fun

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,200
Yeah. And I find playing with these models actually really fun

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,440
So go play with it

24
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,640
Yeah, I agree. It's a good

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,080
a good weekend activity, speaking from experience

26
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,960
And just, you know

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,520
please use the learnings from your first project to build a better second project

28
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,360
and you know, maybe even a better third project, so on

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,960
That's kind of how I have kind of grown over time using these models myself as well

30
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,360
Or if you have an idea for a bigger project already, just, just go for it

31
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,960
And, you know, as a reminder

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,200
these kind of large language models are a very powerful technology

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,120
So it kind of goes without saying that we ask you to use them responsibly

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,960
and please only build things that will have a positive impact

35
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,240
Yeah, fully agree. I think in this age

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,480
people that build AI systems can have a huge impact on others

37
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,960
So it's more important than ever that all of us only use these tools responsibly

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,720
And I think building large language model-based applications

39
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,880
is just a very exciting and growing field right now

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,160
And now that you've finished this course

41
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,240
I think you now have a wealth of knowledge to let

42
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,320
you build things that few people today know how to

43
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:17,280
So I hope you also help us to spread the word and encourage others to take this course too

44
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,520
In closing, I hope you had fun doing this course

45
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,280
and I want to thank you for finishing this course

46
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,120
and both Isa and I look forward to hearing about the amazing things that you've built
