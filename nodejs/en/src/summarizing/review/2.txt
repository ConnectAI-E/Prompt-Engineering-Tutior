Needed a nice lamp for my bedroom, and this one had additional storage and not too high of a price point. Got it fast - arrived in 2 days. The string to the lamp broke during the transit and the company happily sent over a new one. Came within a few days as well. It was easy to put together. Then I had a missing part, so I contacted their support and they very quickly got me the missing piece! Seems to me to be a great company that cares about their customers and products.
