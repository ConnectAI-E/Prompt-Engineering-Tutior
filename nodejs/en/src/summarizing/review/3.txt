My dental hygienist recommended an electric toothbrush, which is why I got this. The battery life seems to be pretty impressive so far. After initial charging and leaving the charger plugged in for the first week to condition the battery, I've unplugged the charger and been using it for twice daily brushing for the last 3 weeks all on the same charge. But the toothbrush head is too small. I’ve seen baby toothbrushes bigger than this one. I wish the head was bigger with different length bristles to get between teeth better because this one doesn’t.  Overall if you can get this one around the $50 mark, it's a good deal. The manufactuer's replacements heads are pretty expensive, but you can get generic ones that're more reasonably priced. This toothbrush makes me feel like I've been to the dentist every day. My teeth feel sparkly clean!
